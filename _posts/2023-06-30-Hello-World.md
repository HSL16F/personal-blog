## Hello World!
### The beginning
*In the beginning there was light.* \
This is a pretty simple first post. \
Just to test how things look and feel on the new blog. \
So about this blog. What wondrous wonders will willfully be written within this here blog.
What will the future foretell for perhaps the most thrilling and exciting amalgamation of words to be constructed, of that to rival of Shakespeare. No. Not rival, surpass. Surpass far beyond anything written by any poet or person present or past. \
I could keep on going however I am running out of bad alliteration and I think it would be in the best interest of myself and you, the wonderful reader that I get to the point.
### What even is this blog?
This website, blog, collection of ideas will be a way for my to write, express and explore different ideas, projects and anything else on my mind. \
Anything that I may feel may be interesting to write about I may write.
It will serve as a method to document my journey and progress throughout life and even as a way to keep myself accountable by writing to a stage, I feel a strong sense to enforce and ensure accountability of myself and projects that I work on. \
I hope that whoever finds this blog will find it interesting and only time will tell how this shall shape. \
So let's conclude this first post and let time's arrow do its both tragic and wonderful thing of marching ever forward. \
All the best to myself, in past, present and future and all within the unkown which awaits. \
