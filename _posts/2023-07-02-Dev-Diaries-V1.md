### Dev Diaries V1.0.0

The first edition of a way for me to basically document my journey of development and learnings and anything I want to discuss related to Software Development and Data Science projects. \
I'll aim to publish something new for every 2 weeks, and we'll see how it goes. Whilst there's no intended topic or theme, I aim to journey my progresses on a few particular projects of mine.

#### Application Problematic Interfaces

API's, love them, hate them. They do a mighty good for us all and they are incredibly powerful tools. I've worked with them many times in the past for different tools and methods of retrieving data, yet I've never designed one myself. Diving into such a project, whilst having little understanding of what API's even are certainly has presented its challenged but quite exciting ones at that. The first and in some regards, most overwhelming challenge I've faces was... what to use? \
The sheet number of products out there, all advertising and presenting new and unique solutions to the problem, of which scope I am not even fully aware of has created a great deal of problem for me. These tools, packages, libraries, third party platforms all appear great, and I am sure they have their uses, yet for someone like me, who is approaching this problem with very little understanding of how to achieve it, but the strong desire and understanding of what I'm trying to achieve has lead to a halting of indecision. \
Do I use the most popular tool out there which will work great and be flashy? \
Do I use the easiest and simplest tool, which fantastic for hobby and individual projects but not suited for anything for commercial purposes due to speed and other restrictions \
Or do I use the fantastic scalable tool which has a steeper learning curve but will pay off within the future? \
Among each of these exhibit a further plethora of 100's of micro decisions which has lead a very confusing and overwhelming journey. \
As it stands, I am deep within the known unknowns territory. I know API's are powerful, I know they do amazing things, build companies, power communications and maintain and interact with just about every aspect of our daily lives. Yet I do not know what I should be aware of, what I need to know, and what is the extra fat that is nice to know, but not needed to ship a demo. \
This known unknown territory is very uncomfortable and one that I do hold the desire to leave, yet the path to leave is in itself a maze. \
For every corner I venture, only do the hedges grow higher deeper into the API labyrinth I fall. \
To combat this fight or flight response to a somewhat simple project, I've held tightly to the mentality of "Just Ship it"


#### Just ship it

I've found it helpful to remind myself of what the consumer, the user cares about. \
When I use some service or platform, I do not care about how its built, what's it like under the hood. I do not care for how functional or a mess it is behind the scenes. All I care is that it works, and if it is in early development, can the product achieve the things its creators do so promise?

Often when creating the initial sketches and prototypes in Figma for even just one of the many more planned pages, I would often get bogged down into the details and suddenly I’ve got a selection of 12 different colour pallets when I haven’t even designed the initial concepts for the webpage.

To counter this, almost everyday I’d remind myself to _just ship it_.


#### Deploying is hard

In addition to much of the theoretical work performed, much of my time has involved figuring out how to develop and deploy both the API and the websites to connect to it. I’ve been quite restricted by the amount I can spend on tools, however thanks to the wonders of open source and a fantastic community, I’ve found DetaSpace for API hosting and deployment and Vercel for deploying the react app. Having dived right into the deep end, I’ve found Vercel and Detaspace to be quite easy to use, and I was quite amazed at just how easy it was to use Vercel.


#### Concise Conclusions

I’ll admit, its rather late at night and I wanted to get this out by Sunday night. I don’t know what I’m writing and this probably doesn’t make all that much sense, but I figured if I can just write something, applying my developing _just ship it_ mentality, then maybe the next 2 weeks will be easier to write. \
This is the first edition of my Dev Diaries, no idea how things will progress, lets just keep it casual and human for now. :)
