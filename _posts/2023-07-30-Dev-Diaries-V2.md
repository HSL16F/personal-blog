### Dev Diaries V1.0.1

Spent some time away, now back to the second edition of dev diaries. After some time thinking, I feel that this these posts will moreso be a way to keep my life on track and provide an update on what's going on in my life and progress every 2 weeks. Whilst I am a university student there is still much change and progress to be made and I hope this will continue to form some momentum throughout life. Maybe I'll retain this as a biweekly writings, or maybe in the future it'll move to a monthly recap. Who knows, only time can tell what the future will held, and for now it is silent. Now onto what to cover as of recent.

## Things to discuss
- Design to redesign mindset
- What I plan this coming semester

### Design to redesgin

One thing I've learnt from this one of my personal projects is to learn to redesign. This will certainly be a reocurring theme throughout these writings. I would continually fall into a trap of thinking the design had to be perfect, or even good. When in reality, it just needs to be usable, functional and no more. What really helped me shift out of this mindset was understood that I would design to redesign. Not designing something to be good or ship it out, but give it room to build and grow, instead, desigining the UI with the plan that I will redesign it later, I felt gave me a healthier mindset of what I am making and provided further motivation. Whilst I understand and am well aware of the concepts of tech debt, I feel that there is a balance to strike between, sloppy quick code and the perfect sequence of syntax, and that balance is something that I am still a long way from mastering, but something of great interest for me to acquire.

### The suffering of study begins again, how to make projects

This semester has begun again, and it is time to get back into the study. Given my current subjects, I aim for this semester to be somewhat relaxed and more of an opportunity for me to engage in various projects and develop my portfolio in addition to my various studies of the subjects of mathematics and Financial Technologies. I'm quite excited and enthusiastic for what I'll be studying. Whilst 2/3 subjects are, as strange as it is for me to write, subjects I will be repeating, I feel much more confident with my ability to think and approach mathematical problems. The fintech subject I am taking this semester is of great excitement for me, after I have discovered my deep passion for fintech. Alongside my studies, I intend this semester to be a time to complete technical projects I have engaged in and be a time of self-discipline and refinement. I have molded myself to slowly become the person I wish to be and now that man is coming into reality. I hope through these writings, I can capture a snapshot frozen in time of my progress, mindset and understanding of myself and my development.

### Concise Conclusions
Still not entirely sure how to properly conclude these. So I'll just leave it here, slowly this... blog, article whatever will mold into its own. For now, I only remain hyper-aware of how little understanding and plan I have for this, other than wishing to publish and get it out. A "Just ship it" in relation to my writings I guess.\
