### Hello World x2
So my plan was to upload more regular posts to here, provide content and examples of my dev work in the form of dev diaries. Oh how well that went. \
I have been pretty busy the past several months. Uni has been quite something and taken up much of my time, still, one can almost always make time for activites and hobbies, but it is never easy to do so. But now that my semester is over, I've got a summer of nothing, perhaps its time to make something. Do something of significance. \
I won't lie, the past few weeks I've been it a bit of a slump, but today I noticed it was December already. When I reflect on the past few months I ask myself what have I achieved. Yes time as moved forward, I have learnt some things, gained some more knowledge but really, there is little of note to be of what I can consider an achievement, or lest, progress towards some achievement. Whilst I have made some non material progress in life, I am not satisfied with such progression and I believe myself capable of more. \
Given it is the month of december already, I figured I'd give myself a simple goal. Something to try and keep on pushing. For *almost* every day of December, bah say Christmas, New Years and any day I will be completly away from my laptop and feel I would not gain use from bringing it, such as hiking. I plan to make at least one push to GitHub. Some progress on some technical skills. \
Its time I make some change, work to improve myself and climb out of this pit of depression I have found myself in. \
I have no real plan or roadmap for what I will make, merely some sticky notes on my desk for projects and ideas. My goal is to update once per week with progress and what I've achieved. By the end of it, who knows what I'll have made, done and learnt. But lets make some use of my time. Do something. Make something people want.
